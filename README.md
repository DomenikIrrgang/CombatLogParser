# CombatlogParser

This is a small project to help someone to get into programming. The timeframe for the project is one week. The result is going to be a console application that is able to parse combatlog-files from the game "World of Warcraft" and export those results to a file or print it on the console. The CombatlogParser is going to be written in Java.
In the end this page is going to get updated with a small tutorial on how to use the parser.
