<h1>Fraction</h1>
<br>
1. Implement a fraction class that is able to add/subtract/multiply/divide another fraction to itself and return the result.<br>
2. Implement that every fraction gets reduced automatically on creation.<br>
3. Try to rethink your way of implementing your calculation functions. (is there someway to reuse other methods?)
